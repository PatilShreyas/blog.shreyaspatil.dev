## 2026-06-08 - Accessible Dynamic Elements Pattern
**Learning:** Dynamically injected UI elements (like code copy buttons) often miss critical accessibility and visual interaction states that static elements natively have. Setting `aria-live="polite"` handles state changes (e.g. from "Copy" to "Copied!") for screen readers correctly, while `active:scale-95` gives a physical-feeling tap feedback.
**Action:** When adding JS-generated UI components, systematically add hover/active states and ensure ARIA attributes (label, title, live) update synchronously with visual state changes.

## 2026-06-09 - Descriptive Action Tooltips on Toggles
**Learning:** For toggle buttons (like theme switchers), providing an `aria-label` or `title` that purely states the current state (e.g. "dark" or "auto") isn't fully informative to users hovering or using screen readers.
**Action:** Use action-oriented labels like "Switch to dark theme" so the user knows exactly what will happen when they click it. Keep these attributes dynamic so they always reflect the next intended state.
## 2025-06-19 - Active Navigation Links Missing Spatial Context
**Learning:** Adding a visual active state (like an underline or color change) to a navigation link is insufficient for screen reader users. They need a semantic indicator to understand which page is currently active.
**Action:** Always add `aria-current="page"` dynamically to the active item in navigation lists to ensure proper spatial orientation for screen reader users.
